/**
 * Highlight Effect Animation.
 *
 * This SCSS file defines a CSS animation that temporarily highlights an
 * element (such as an input field) by changing its background color to
 * yellow and then fading it back to transparent.
 *
 * This exists as a visual cue to users indicating where the block search
 * field is located.
 *
 * Classes:
 * - `.highlight-effect`: Applies the animation to an element.
 *
 * Animations:
 * - `highlightFade`: A 1-second animation that starts with a yellow
 *   background and smoothly fades back to transparent.
